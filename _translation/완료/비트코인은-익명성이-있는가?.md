# 비트코인은 익명성이 있는가?
*  [비트코인 메거진](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/bitcoin-magazine) 2020년 8월 17일

Bitcoin is not entirely anonymous. In reality, it is /pseudonymous/ because each user has a public address that theoretically could be traced back to an IP address or exchange account (and by proxy, an actual identity) through proper network analysis.
비트코인은 완전히 익명이 아니다. 실제로는 각 사용자가 적절한 네트워크 분석을 통해 IP 주소나 교환 계정(그리고 프록시에 의해 실제 ID)으로 거슬러 올라갈 수 있는 공개 주소를 가지고 있기 때문에 /가명/이다.

So instead, a better question is, /to what extent/ is Bitcoin anonymous?
그래서 대신, 더 나은 질문은 비트코인이 어느 정도까지 익명이냐는 것이다.

It is anonymous in the sense that the components of Bitcoin, such as addresses, private and public keys, and transactions, are all read in text strings, such as a public address, that in no way directly link to anyone’s personal identity. (If an address is used on an exchange that implements KYC — Know Your Customer — then that address may be easily linked to a real-world identity.)
주소, 개인 및 공용 키, 거래와 같은 비트코인의 구성요소가 모두 공개 주소와 같은 텍스트 문자열로 읽혀진다는 점에서 익명성이 있다. (KYC - Know Your Customer를 구현하는 거래소에서 주소를 사용하는 경우 해당 주소는 실제 ID와 쉽게 연결될 수 있습니다.)

General understanding of blockchain technology by the public was not prevalent in Bitcoin’s early days. It was commonly thought that Bitcoin was a safe haven for criminals and terrorists because it was untraceable and entirely anonymous. As blockchain technology became more understood by organizations and the public alike, it became more apparent that Bitcoin’s massive public ledger was actually a gold mine of information for authorities instead; any bitcoin transactions that have ever taken place are forever inscribed in an immutable ledger.
비트코인 초기에는 블록체인 기술에 대한 일반인들의 이해가 성행하지 않았다. 비트코인은 추적할 수 없고 완전히 익명이었기 때문에 범죄자와 테러리스트들의 안전한 피난처라고 일반적으로 생각되었다. 블록체인 기술이 조직과 대중 모두에게 더 많이 이해됨에 따라, 비트코인의 거대한 공개 장부는 사실 대신 당국에게 정보의 금광이라는 것이 더욱 분명해졌다.

Every bitcoin transaction is publicly broadcasted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Because all transactions are permanent and public, a massive map is being created as time goes on that allows simple analytical tools to paint a picture of where bitcoins are going. Bitcoin addresses are “anonymous,” but if an address can somehow be linked to a real-world identity, Bitcoin offers no privacy. There are a number of ways to connect addresses to real-world identities, most notably via KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) policies at exchanges and blockchain analysis (eg., address clustering).
모든 비트코인 거래는 비트코인 블록체인에 공개된다. 모든 거래가 영구적이고 공개적이기 때문에 시간이 지날수록 간단한 분석 도구가 비트코인이 어디로 가고 있는지 그림을 그릴 수 있는 거대한 지도가 만들어지고 있다. 비트코인 주소는 "익명"이지만, 만약 주소가 어떻게든 실제 세계의 정체성과 연결될 수 있다면, 비트코인은 프라이버시를 제공하지 않는다. 실제 ID에 주소를 연결하는 방법은 여러 가지가 있는데, 특히 거래소 및 블록체인 분석(예: 주소 클러스터링)에서 KYC/AML(Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) 정책을 통해 주소를 연결할 수 있다.

There are  [a number of privacy-enhancing tools available](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-privacycoin-tech-making-bitcoin-more-private)  for Bitcoin users as well, but most aren’t perfect. Unless you really know what you’re doing, it’s best to assume you have little privacy.
비트코인 사용자들을 위한 수많은 개인 정보 보호 도구들이 있지만, 대부분은 완벽하지 않다. 당신이 정말로 무엇을 하고 있는지 알지 못하는 한, 당신이 사생활이 거의 없다고 가정하는 것이 최선이다.

### WHAT ARE BITCOIN MIXERS?
### 비트코인 믹서란?
Bitcoin mixers are solutions (software or services) that let users mix their coins with other users, in order to preserve their privacy.
비트코인 믹서(Bitcoin mixer)는 사용자가 자신의 코인을 다른 사용자와 혼합하여 개인 정보를 보호하도록 하는 솔루션(소프트웨어 또는 서비스)이다.

While Bitcoin addresses are “pseudonymous” — meaning, they don’t, in themselves, reveal the identity of their owner — they can often still be linked to real-world identities. For example, if you withdraw bitcoin from an exchange where you’ve identified yourself, the exchange knows that the withdrawal address is yours. There are also more advanced techniques — such as blockchain analysis — to tie Bitcoin addresses to real-world identities.
비트코인 주소는 "가명"이지만 – 즉, 그것 자체가 주인의 신분을 드러내지 않는다는 것을 의미하지만 – 그것들은 종종 현실 세계의 정체성과 연결될 수 있다. 예를 들어 본인 확인이 된 거래소에서 비트코인을 인출하면 거래소는 출금 주소가 본인임을 알게 된다. 비트코인 주소를 실제 ID와 연결하기 위한 블록체인 분석과 같은 더 진보된 기술도 있다.

The next time coins move from these addresses, users risk revealing all sorts of personal information. Depending on how they spend the coins, they could reveal how many coins they own (even on other addresses), what they spend their money on, and more.
다음에 동전이 이 주소에서 이동할 때, 사용자들은 모든 종류의 개인 정보를 노출시킬 위험을 무릅쓴다. 그들이 동전을 어떻게 사용하느냐에 따라, 그들은 얼마나 많은 동전을 소유하고 있는지, 그리고 무엇을 위해 돈을 사용하는지 등을 밝힐 수 있다.

By mixing their coins, users can obscure the ties between their Bitcoin addresses and real-world identities. This allows them to use Bitcoin more privately.
코인을 혼합함으로써, 사용자들은 비트코인 주소와 실제 신원 사이의 관계를 모호하게 할 수 있다. 이는 그들이 비트코인을 더 개인적으로 사용할 수 있게 해준다.

### HOW DO BITCOIN MIXERS WORK?
### 비트코인 믹서는 어떻게 작동하는가?
A number of mixing strategies have been proposed and developed over the years. These range from  [fully centralized solutions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/shuffling-coins-to-protect-privacy-and-fungibility-a-new-take-on-traditional-mixing-1465934826)  where all users trust a mixer, to  [solutions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/shuffling-coins-to-protect-privacy-and-fungibility-a-new-take-on-traditional-mixing-1465934826)  where users don’t need to trust anyone, to  [solutions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/shuffling-coins-to-protect-privacy-and-fungibility-a-new-take-on-traditional-mixing-1465934826)  that resemble Lightning Network-style payment channels, to even using privacy coins like Monero as an  [intermediary step](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-bitcoin-users-reclaim-their-privacy-through-its-anonymous-sibling-monero-1472761633)  in the mixing process.

Instead of exploring all (potential) options, let’s stick to two of the most popular solutions available today.
모든 (잠재적) 옵션을 탐색하는 대신, 현재 사용 가능한 가장 인기 있는 솔루션 두 가지를 고수해 보겠습니다.

*CENTRALIZED MIXERS*
*중앙화된 믹서*

Centralized mixers are services that accept bitcoin payments and send different coins in return. If many people use a particular mixing service, it becomes increasingly difficult for an outsider to tie any of the “incoming” coins to any of the “outgoing” coins. This breaks the transaction trail, offering privacy to the users.

Centralized mixers leave two big problems unsolved, however. One, users need to trust their privacy with the mixer. Since the mixer knows exactly which user sent and received which coins, the mixer could re-establish the trail of ownership. If the mixer is willing to share this data with interested parties (perhaps because they have to by law or in return for payment), the user would lose his privacy after all. And two — perhaps even worse — the mixer could refuse to make the return payment, basically stealing the user’s coins.

*CHAUMIAN COINJOIN MIXERS*

More modern mixers have solved both of these problems. Chaumian CoinJoin mixers, for example, let a large group of users cooperate in making one large payment to themselves. Basically, if a hundred users all send exactly 0.1 BTC to a new address they control, and then merge these 100 transactions into one big transaction, everyone gets 0.1 bitcoin back, but no one can see where they got it from.

On top of that, Chaumian CoinJoin mixers can be designed in such a way that not even the entity that “merges” the transaction can figure out which coins went where. Nor could it steal any coins: Users wouldn’t sign the merged transaction if they didn’t get their 0.1 BTC back.

### WHAT ARE SOME POPULAR MIXERS?

An example of a popular centralized mixer is  [smartmix.io](https://smartmix.io/) . However, /Bitcoin Magazine/does not endorse, let alone recommend using any centralized mixers, including smartmix.io, because of the unsolved problems mentioned above.
 [Wasabi Wallet](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/)  is a popular bitcoin wallet that has a Chaumian CoinJoin mixer built in. And while Wasabi Wallet’s infrastructure is technically centralized, it is cleverly designed so the operator cannot deanonymize users nor steal any funds. It also offers a user-friendly interface to help users distinguish between mixed coins and non-mixed coins.

Similar to Wasabi Wallet, the  [Samourai](https://samouraiwallet.com/)  wallet also offers a Chaumian CoinJoin mixing service, called Whirlpool. While Wasabi Wallet is currently only available on desktop, Samourai is also available on mobile. However, to really use Samourai Wallet in a privacy-friendly manner (where users’ privacy is protected even from the Samourai Wallet team), users do need to connect their wallet to their own full Bitcoin node.

An alternative option to mixing coins is using  [JoinMarket](https://joinmarket.me/) . JoinMarket allows users to merge transactions into bigger transactions through (regular) CoinJoin, which also helps obfuscate their trail of coins and protects their privacy. An interesting benefit of JoinMarket is that participants in such merges are financially incentivized to offer their coins to be mixed: Users that want to mix their coins would pay a small amount of fee to be able to do so.

### WHY WOULD YOU MIX YOUR COINS?

You would mix your coins to protect your privacy, and there are many reasons to protect your privacy. In short, you might not necessarily want the world to know where you spend your money, what you earn or how much bitcoin you own.

Take the more concrete example of someone who just got a raise. They may not want their landlord to find out, as this landlord might see it as a good opportunity to increase the rent. A closeted-homosexual may want to pay for gay pornnography without anyone knowing, especially in a regime where being gay is treated like a crime. A dissident pseudonymous journalist may want to get paid for his articles without the regime in his country finding out who he is. A teenage girl from a conservative family might want to purchase contraception without her parents finding out. A Democrat in a Republican town may want to donate money to his favored politician without drawing the ire of his neighbours. A wealthy bitcoiner may not want to reveal his holdings as it would make him a target for kidnapping, extortion or worse. And so on.

Really, there are quite literally countless reasons why people may want privacy. In fact, even if you do not care about your own privacy at all, you may want to altruistically mix your coins to increase the anonymity set of people who do.

### IS COIN MIXING JUST FOR CRIMINALS?

As pointed out above, no, coin mixing and other forms of privacy are not just for criminals. In fact, privacy is a human right established in the  [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)  (article 12).

Of course, criminals do benefit from all sorts of privacy as well, including privacy gained from mixing their coins. Criminals enjoy many of the freedoms that the rest of us do; that’s the price we pay to live in a free society. (And even in regimes without many such freedoms, criminals tend to continue to operate … and “criminals” may, in these places, be people that speak the truth or hold a certain belief.)

Indeed, the perception that mixers are mainly used by criminals appears to be false. According to [ research](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/chainalysis-most-mixed-bitcoin-not-used-for-illicit-purposes)  by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, for example, mixers are mostly used by regular Bitcoin users that simply want privacy. Coins that have been used for illicit purposes represent a minority of all mixed coins.

### CAN BITCOIN MIXERS BE BANNED?

Whether or not bitcoin mixers can be banned is really a legal question — not a technical question. It will, therefore, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are  [examples](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/dutch-authorities-shut-down-bestmixer)  of mixers that have been banned, as authorities claimed that the service was being used to launder money.

The most popular mixing services are currently centralized (either trusted or untrusted), which does mean they could be shut down relatively easily by authorities. So far, however, many mixing services continue to operate unencumbered.

If centralized mixing services do face bans and shutdowns, decentralized mixing services might take their place. These would be harder to take down.

### DO MIXED COINS RUN THE RISK OF BEING LABELLED AS ‘TAINTED’?

Depending on how coins are mixed, it can be possible to recognize mixed coins as “tainted.” Mixers like the one used by Wasabi Wallet leave a clear trail of mixing. So while the premix history of the coins would be obscured, the mixing itself would not be.

At the time of writing this article, no mixed coins have been labeled as tainted and refused by bitcoin exchanges or merchants, however.

### WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN ANALYSIS?

The Bitcoin blockchain is an open and transparent ledger. This means that every payment is publicly visible to anyone. As such, it’s easy to see how coins move from address to address. (This is not completely, technically the best way to phrase it, but it’s close enough for the purposes of this introductory guide.)

*Further Reading:  * [What Is a Blockchain?](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-blockchain) 

On top of having an open and transparent ledger, the way Bitcoin transactions are constructed often reveals information about users. Most notably, a transaction that has several “inputs” (chunks of coin) suggests that all of these inputs belong to the same user. This allows for address clustering, but there are many other such privacy leaks. (See the  [Bitcoin Privacy wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy)  for more examples.)

As the name suggests, blockchain analysis is the act of using such privacy leaks to analyze the blockchain.
